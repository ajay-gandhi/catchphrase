# Catchphrase

Catchphrase board game in JS.

## Rules

The game is played in two teams. The goal for each player is to get _their_ team
to say the word or phrase. One member of a team starts the round and tries to
get his or her team to guess the displayed word or phrase.

A clue-giver can *not* make any physical gestures, but can give almost any
verbal clue except:

* Say a word that rhymes with any of the words
* Give the first letter of a word
* Say the number of syllables
* Say part of any word in the clue

When the team guesses correctly, the other team takes its turn. The round
continues until the timer runs out. The opposite team scores a point when time
runs out. The first team to score 7 points wins.
